		When the Imperium was very much in its infancy it was lead by a near mythical-god like being known
		as the Emperor. The Emperor rose from a wartime period in ancient Terras history to conquer all other rivals
		to eventually form the basis of what would become known as his Grand Crusade into the stars to unite all the 
		lost colonies of man to his side so that he may make mankind the most predominate race in the galaxy.
		He could not achieve this alone however and so begun the creation of 20 superhuman infants that would become his
		generals and statesmen to lead humanity in their conquest. Yet in so creating these super natural beings by channeling
		aspects of the warp into their bodies they had become suspectable to corruption and the whims of much darker powers.
		Fearful that this Emperor would succed in his plans of conquering the stars with his Primachs the Dark Gods using
		their mastery of the warp swept into the Emperors labourtory and scattered them across the galaxy. Yet hardly thwarted
		the Emperor devised a new plan using samples of the genetics to make the Primarch the Emperor instead created a blend
		of superwarriors who later to become known as the Adptus Astrates or Space marines. These children of the Primarch would
		go onto to be fathered by each recovered primach as the Emperor journeyed across the stars to see humanity reuined.
		Over time he had found each one of his sons, each proving to be an indispensable asset however not each one had
		accepted their fathers intervention willingly and some had grown tocome to resent him for a life otherwise robbed or
		taken for ambition of an otherwise ungodly being.

		<p4><img src="Images\Crown.jpg" alt="Image" width="645" height="420" align="right"> Yet among his sons,recognised as
		best of his peers the Emperor bestowed upon Horus the rank of Warmaster, to lead the grand crusade
		in his stead as he returned to ancient Terra to work upon a project of the most great importance. though
		for all his wisdom the Emperor had not deign to tell even his favriout son what that project was. This among 
		other things added to the list of questionable moral choices and deeds that the Warmaster committed in
		the Emperors name as he prosecuted His crusade. As the crusade went onwards without its Emperor Horus felt
		overwhelmed by his sole role and responsibility to act as Warmaster, that soon turned into resentment for
		his father seemingly abandoning him to an endless crusade as buerocrates and corrupt officials appointed and 
		sent by Him begun to meddle further and further in prosecution in His crusade..

		<p5> Eventually the Warmaster snapped as well as influenced by other dissatisfied Primarchs the Horus heresey
		began in earnest as half of the Space marine legions turned on Emperor crusading back across the stars
		to ancient terra and the proveniences of loyalest legions to waylay to the Empire they had once fought to build.
		Institutions like the Imperial Army to the technologically advance Adeptus Mechanicius splintered at the seams as
		Horus drew ever closer to the Emperors palace waylaying to anything and everything that stood in his way as 
		champion of the four Dark Gods.

		<p6>On the verge of conquering the Emperors palace on ancient terra Horus lowered the shields on his warship the 
			Venegful Spirit allowing for the Emperor and his cohort of elitie custodies to mass teleport aboard
			and confront him at last father to son. But before the Emperor had reached Horus his loylatist brother
			Primach Sanguinius had first but was no match for Horus as he was bloated on the power of the Dark Gods.
			Thus already wounded and weary from the battle on Terra itself Sanguinius was no match for Horus.
			If the Emperor had still doubted his son falling as far as he had it was in this moment witnessing the
			monstrosity Horus had become so callously striking down one of his brothers that the Emperor knew he had to 
			stop him. Both the mythical beings the Emperor of mankind and Horus the Warmaster fought a vicious duel on both
			a psychical and mental plan. Yet still for all he had done the Emperor could not bring himself to strike down
			his favorite son and hesitates. This hesitation costed the Emperor dearly as he suffered near fatal injuries
			that put him at Horuses feet. Laughing his victory a custodies of the Emperor rushed to his aid without
			hesitance but was atomized by the power Horus wieled without batting an eyelash. Seeing that only someone
			bolstered by the direct patronage of the chaos gods combined did the Emperor realize that he had to destroy
			Horus utterly and striked him down with psychic bolt after psychic bolt no longer restrained as he was before.
			Horus was overwhelmed and the Dark Gods lending him their power knew his fate was sealed and withdrew their
			patronage leaving Horus nothing more than his lesser self.
			Horus was destroyed but the cost had been great.

		<p7> Near death the Emperor was intered upon a golden throne forever condemned to watch over his empire as a 
			psychic becon of hope to allow mankind safe passage through the perilous nature of the warp as well as
			ward off the Chaos Gods power of snatching up the scraps of humanity like an inhuman flood, comprimised 
			as his project was to attempt mapping out a highway across the ever shifting sea of the hellish warp. 
			Defeated the traitor Astrate legions fled to the Eye of Terror a region of space that was held in the grip of
			the warp and considered the domain of the Chaos Gods. It was belived by the Imperium that the traitors
			had been swallowed up never to blight their Imperium again....

		<p8> 10'000 years later the traitor legions had returned to the Galaxy. Spewing forth from hell itself Abadon
		first captain of the Luna Wolves, the Sons of Horus and now reborn as the Black legion begun his 1st of 13 Black
		Crusades to sunder the Imperium once again and dethrone its rotting Emperor. Even with Horuses death the traitor 
		legions had not lost all its deamonic primarchs and to the unbeliving now religiously fantacily devoted Imperium's 
		surpise they had seemily returned stronger and more hateful than ever. Since Abadons return other Legions had also
		made their returns blighting the galaxy and the Imperium as they struck out with their own deamonic ambitions and
		plots. Myraid are the legions and cultures that define them as are the goals or ambitions of the warlords that hold
		them together. Whether they serve the dark gods willingly or not they are classed as instrumental pawns of Chaos 
		for no matter the purpose their deeds have no been forgotten by their loaylist kin and the only redemption to be
		found would be wrought in blood much to the Dark Gods pleasure.
