		Most depraved and hedonistic of traitor Legions the Emperors Children ever strive for perfection in all things 
		from combat skills to appearance and style. During the Horus Heresey it said by their traitorous kin that they craved
		the capture of slaves than the conquering of the Emperors palace and individuals like Fubious Bile is not restrained
		enough to dare cloning Primarchs or resurrecting the likes of Horus himself much to the disrespectful act it was even
		to the other traitorous legions.

		Masters of Siege craft the Iron Warriors know no equal in breaching and destruction of fortresses and fortifications
		save for the Imperial fists a legion rivaling them for their prowess in the construction of unbreakable fortifications.
		Something of a more tragic traitor legion the Iron Warriors where sent into some the harshest conflicts during the Great Crusade
		or worse left to garrisoning roles where there strength was in in sacking garrisons. Perturabo cold and most mechanical
		of Primachs foresaw war down to its most mathematical of schemes however lacked empathy in sympathizing or rationalizing
		with human emotions or grievances. He saw only the Emperors will to conquer and a rebellious home-world unable or unwilling to send
		him reinforcements. Thus did he burn his world to a cinder destroying the divided city states and thus sealed the fate
		for himself and the Iron Warriors their honor now permanently besmirched by such a horrific deed.

		The Night lords are obsessed with preying upon those weaker than themselves. Since the martydoom of their Primach,
		the Legion has devolved into warbands of cynical, ruthless warriors who live to inspire fear within the teeming 
		masses.The meticulously enacted atrocities they inflict before each battle waken the enemy's resolve before the
		killing blow is delivered.

		Always famous for their unparalleled martial abilities, the World Eaters gradually devolved into a Legion of
		blood-hungry maniacs owing allegiance only to Khorne, the Lord of Battle. Their Primach Angron grew upon a world
		that was dominated by gladiator combat. So much so that slaves brains where augmented by a brutual insertion
		of spikes known as butcher nails that heightened its victums aggresion to commit acts of violence least they
		endure great periods of insurmountable pain. Augmented as such Angron became a mighty champion but always escape
		had been formost in his ambitions but time again his masters recaptured him and came to the realization that
		he needed the help of others should he prove successful. During an event where a game unlike any other was being
		prepared by Angron himself he had formulated a plan and when the moment came the slaves turned on their armed 
		guards and sacked the city in a horde like rush taking what needed to fight and survive before fleeing into 
		distant northern mountains in the process sacking whatever stood in their way the Horde earning the name of
		World Eaters.

		During the Horus Heresy, the Thousand Sons sought to harness the forbidden power of Chaos to further
		their own enlightenment. They had succeded for a time but its useage eventually produced a vibrant mutation
		that was spreading among their number after fleeing Propero after the Wolves of Fenrus were sent by the 
		Emperor to purge them. In an effort to quash the rampant mutation among the ranks of the legion the Thousand
		Sons chief libraian Ahirman proposed casting a mighty spell known as the Rubrica to purge the mutation from the
		legion.

		Acording to the Imperial truth the Emperor had never wanted mankind to venerate Him as a God. Yet the
		Word Bearers worshiped him as such regardless giving over time a resources to churcly building and states.
		This consumed so much time that the Word Beaeres pace in the Great Crusade moved at an agonising pace so much
		so that the Emperor grew frustrated with his son and ordered that the worship be ceased. But the worship contunied
		and it was not until the Emperor sent the Ultramarines legion to sack one their cities of aclamined perfect worship
		forcing the Word Beaeres to witness the destruction and scolding them as failure to humanity that the worship had seemingly
		ceased now that his son Lorgar was broken and chastised. In his despair Lorgar was offered insight into the existence
		of Chaos and their Gods establishing the beginnings of an order of daemonic zealots and worshipers who could very well
		be almost single handedly responsible for fanning the flames of corruption throughout the diswrought Primach and legions.
