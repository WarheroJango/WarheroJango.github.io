		<p>You're probably wondering why you're here. What perverted thought made you search
			for this place...rest assured it is not a place for the faint of heart or those
			too weak to embrace the possibility madness. But if you are strong, wise or cunning
			enough then perhaps you can find a place amongst the damned and the lost, of demonkin and
			cursed mortal men who purse power through any means necessary. Step forth and claim thy prize
			or fall in amusement to the powers of Chaos! For either way....<br><p>
