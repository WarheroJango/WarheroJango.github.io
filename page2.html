		<p2> Chaos is represented by many creatures in the 40,000 universe. Mortal men, xenos, Astraties
			and demons just to name afew but all pale before what truely gives Chaos its substance. The Dark Gods.
			Powerful demonic entities spawned by the culimnation of dead souls resonating in pure undiluted emotions
			of Rage, Decay, Lust and Power across an underworld realm of boundless reality known as the warp. They're
			history is long and varied but it is enough for you, mortal to know that they possess powers beyound any keen
			mortal sense and are the ultimate power that will destroy the Imperium of Man and dethrone its corpse bound Emperor.
			Mightest of their servants are the fallen Astartes Legions who will pave the way to ancient Terra and bring unto them
			a victory unlike any other.
